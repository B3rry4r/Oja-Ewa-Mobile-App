This document provides a high-level overview of the 21 AI-powered features implemented in the Ojaewa Nigerian fashion marketplace.

## 1. Cultural & Content Intelligence

### **Cultural AI Assistant (Buyer)**
Powered by Gemini 1.5, this assistant is injected with deep knowledge of Nigerian fashion culture. It understands tribal attire (Agbada, Iro and Buba, Baban Riga, etc.) and can advise buyers on etiquette and what to wear based on specific ethnic contexts (e.g., a Yoruba wedding vs. a Hausa ceremony).

### **Smart Product Descriptions (Seller)**
Automatically generates SEO-friendly, culturally relevant product descriptions. It turns basic data into high-intent copy using keywords like "Owambe ready" and tribal identifiers, ensuring products rank higher and resonate with local buyers.

### **AI Product Photography (Seller)**
A "Studio-in-Pocket" tool that generates professional AI prompts to describe products on virtual Nigerian models or in realistic scenes (Lagos streets, wedding halls), which can be used in image generators to create professional marketing assets.

### **Marketing Copy Generation (Seller)**
Generates platform-specific captions (Instagram), ads (Facebook), and newsletters using local fashion terminology and slang to drive higher engagement.

## 2. Market Analytics & Demand

### **Smart Inventory Prediction (Seller)**
Analyzes sales velocity alongside a seasonal Nigerian fashion calendar (Harmattan, Rainy Season, Weddings, Festivals). It predicts future stock requirements, identifying "must-stock" items and marking "slow-moving" inventory to optimize procurement budgets.

### **Pricing Optimization (Seller)**
Benchmarks products against real-time marketplace data for specific categories (e.g., "Silk Buba") to suggest optimal pricing that balances competitiveness with profit margins.

### **Competition Analysis (Seller)**
Identifies "Market Gaps"—underserved segments where buyer demand is high but availability is low, allowing sellers to pivot to more profitable niches.

### **Demand Forecasting (Seller)**
Predicts trending colors, sizes, and styles for upcoming seasons (e.g., predicting Indigo Blue as the top trending color for the festive season).

### **Return Risk Prediction (Seller)**
Flags orders at high risk of return based on category-specific sizing data or product reviews, allowing sellers to verify details with buyers before shipping.

### **Smart Visual Search (Buyer)**
Allows buyers to upload photos or screenshots of outfits to instantly find the closest matches or similar items within the Ojaewa marketplace.

### **Size & Fit Prediction (Buyer)**
Compares a buyer’s individual measurements against product reviews and aggregate category data to provide personalized sizing advice, reducing "fit uncertainty."
