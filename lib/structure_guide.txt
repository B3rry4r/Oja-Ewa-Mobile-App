Recommended scalable structure (feature-first + core):

lib/
  main.dart                 -> entrypoint (minimal)

  app/
    app.dart                -> root widget (MaterialApp)
    router/
      app_router.dart       -> routes + navigation setup
    theme/
      app_theme.dart        -> ThemeData, colors, typography

  core/                     -> shared, cross-feature code
    (suggested subfolders)
    - config/               (env, build flavors)
    - constants/            (app constants)
    - errors/               (exceptions/failures)
    - network/              (dio client, interceptors)
    - storage/              (secure storage, hive, drift)
    - utils/                (helpers, extensions)
    - widgets/              (reusable UI primitives)and 

  features/
    <feature_name>/
      data/                 -> repositories, datasources, DTOs
      domain/               -> entities, use-cases, interfaces
      presentation/         -> screens, widgets, controllers/providers

Naming conventions:
- snake_case for files/folders
- one feature per folder under features/
- keep app-wide singletons/providers in core/ (or app/ if purely app-shell)

Tip:
- With Riverpod, place providers near the layer that owns them:
  - presentation: UI state providers (StateNotifier/Notifier)
  - data: repository providers
  - core: shared providers (dio client, databases)
