I have Figma design data in IR (Intermediate Representation) format. Please write clean, professional Flutter code that accurately implements this design.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **VISUAL FIDELITY FIRST** - Capture the designer's exact visual intent, even if IR data has inconsistencies
2. **PROFESSIONAL UI/UX** - Build production-ready interfaces, not just literal IR translation
3. **INFER VISUAL INTENT** - When IR data conflicts with visual patterns, prioritize what makes visual sense
4. **MAINTAIN SEMANTICS** - Keep functional meaning intact while improving visual accuracy

## HOW TO INTERPRET THE IR:
- Look at the design holistically - what is the visual story?
- Identify repeating patterns, visual groups, and hierarchy
- The root frame often represents the device/screen shape (rounded corners for mobile)
- Background colors typically apply to entire sections, not just containers
- Spacing should create visual rhythm, not just follow exact coordinates
- Overlap often indicates decorative elements or visual layers

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Package name**: ojaewa
- **Responsive design**: Use SingleChildScrollView, Expanded, Flexible as needed
- **Prevent overflows**: Handle text overflow, content clipping
- **Inline styling**: No design system classes
- **Use const** where possible for performance
- **Fix IR errors**: Correct obvious positioning mistakes
- **Semantic grouping**: Group related elements logically

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Name the file appropriately based on screen purpose/function
2. Write complete, runnable .dart code
3. Include all necessary imports
4. Add brief comments for complex sections
5. Explain key design decisions

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Think like a UI/UX designer, not just a developer
- Prioritize visual harmony and user experience
- Create interfaces that feel intentional and polished
- Balance IR data with real-world UI patterns

Now, here's the IR data:
